I DESIGNED A PERSIAN WEBSITE FOR SELLING PRODUCTS THERE.
At first, I used a separate header and footer template, but because JavaScript didn't work that way, I had to put the header and footer of each page in the same page template.
I have created several modules. Home_module for the home page, product_module for product pages, contact_module to create the address and information of the site owner to communicate, and a user_module to register and log in users as well as register information.
I also created statics folder for js, css and images.
Also, I put the Utils folder for some tools, such as generating a random code for users to enter.
This project can manage products and categories and their prices and details in the admin section of the site. Also, products have a one-to-many relationship with categories in the database.
Users can register in the registration section. Enter in the login section. During registration, a code is generated that is displayed in the database in the user information section.
